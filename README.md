# SASSY---Spectral-Analysis-System-for-Stellar-Yields
A Neural Net for classifying stars into stellar classes from spectra data

This is a heavy-handed approach to stellar classification for the sake of investigating the utility and limitations of neural network processing.

This project relies on data accessed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). See https://www.sdss.org/ for more information.

Astroquery ( https://github.com/astropy/astroquery ) was relied upon in order to manage contact with SDSS.

Tensorflow ( https://www.tensorflow.org/ ) is thanked for doing much of the heavy lifting on the computation side for neuralnet processing.
